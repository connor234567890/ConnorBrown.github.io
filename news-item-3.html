  <h1>AI NPC Mods Are Changing Single-Player Games</h1>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 15, 2026</p>

  <p>Modders are already experimenting with AI-driven NPCs in games like Skyrim, GTA V, and Mount & Blade. By connecting characters to language models, these mods allow NPCs to hold natural conversations, remember past interactions, and react dynamically to player choices. Some even support voice input, letting players speak directly to characters.</p>

  <p>This trend shows what players want: deeper immersion and more responsive worlds. Instead of repeating preset dialogue, characters can invent backstories, argue, or adapt their behavior based on how they’re treated. While these mods aren’t always polished, they demonstrate the real potential of AI in gameplay.</p>

  <p><strong>My perspective:</strong> modding communities are effectively testing the future of AI in games before major studios fully adopt it. These experiments highlight both the promise and the design challenges of moving beyond scripted NPCs.</p>
